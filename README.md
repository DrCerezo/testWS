For your interest...

I've tested the program with the different test cases provided, 
but for the third case test I can't obtain the value expected 
for the sales taxes.

I made the calcullations by hand applying the round proposed in the
exercise during different phases and I can obtain a sales taxes of 6.70
in any case. That the reason why I changed the test case with the value
to 6.66.
